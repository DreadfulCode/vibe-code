# Next Steps for shadcn/ui Implementation

Now that we have our style guide and implementation plan in place, here are the immediate next steps to begin implementing shadcn/ui with a focus on typography and code blocks.

## 1. Switch to Code Mode

Since Architect mode can only edit Markdown files, you'll need to switch to Code mode to implement the actual changes:

```
/mode code
```

## 2. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
# Install the essential dependencies needed for typography and code blocks
npm install class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge
npm install next-themes
npm install -D tailwindcss-animate
```

## 3. Create Core Files

### Create src/lib/utils.ts

This utility file is essential for shadcn/ui components:

```typescript
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"
 
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```

### Update tailwind.config.js

Update your Tailwind configuration to include the necessary configuration for typography and code blocks, while preserving your existing configuration.

### Update src/styles/global.css

Add the necessary CSS variables for shadcn/ui, while preserving your existing styles.

## 4. Create Test Pages

Create the typography and code block test pages as outlined in the implementation plan:

1. Create the typography components
2. Create the code block component
3. Create test pages to verify they work correctly

## 5. Test and Verify

1. Run the development server
2. Visit the test pages
3. Verify that the components work correctly
4. Check for any layout issues

## 6. Incremental Integration

Once the test pages are working correctly, begin the incremental integration process:

1. Start with typography improvements
2. Move on to code block improvements
3. Test thoroughly after each change

## 7. Documentation

Keep the style guide and implementation plan updated as you make changes.

## TDD Approach

As you requested, consider using a Test-Driven Development approach:

1. Write tests for each component
2. Implement the component
3. Verify that the tests pass
4. Refactor as needed

This approach will help ensure that your changes don't break existing functionality.

## Remember

- Make changes incrementally
- Test thoroughly after each change
- Focus on typography and code blocks first
- Don't change existing layouts until you're confident in the new components
