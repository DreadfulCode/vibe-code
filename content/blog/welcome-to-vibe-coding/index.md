# Welcome to Vibe Coding With Fred

Hello and welcome to my developer blog! I'm excited to share coding insights, tips, and tutorials with you. This blog is designed to make learning and sharing code a pleasant experience.

## What Makes This Blog Special

### Beautiful Code Blocks

Code blocks are styled with syntax highlighting and line numbers for better readability:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to Vibe Coding With Fred.`;
}

console.log(greet("Developer"));
```

### Run JavaScript Code

You can run JavaScript code directly in the browser:

```javascript
// Try running this code!
function calculateFactorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
}

console.log("Factorial of 5:", calculateFactorial(5));
console.log("Factorial of 10:", calculateFactorial(10));
```

### Image Embedding

Images are automatically optimized and look great on all devices. They're also stored on a CDN for fast loading.

## What's Coming Next

In the upcoming posts, I'll be covering:

- JavaScript tips and tricks for 2025
- React hooks and how to use them effectively
- CSS Grid layouts
- TypeScript best practices
- Image optimization in Gatsby
- And much more!

Stay tuned for regular updates. Feel free to reach out if there are specific topics you'd like me to cover.

Happy coding!
